# COG Specifications

COGs (Covia Open Grid specifications) are formal  documents that define the technical standards, protocols, and governance mechanisms of the grid ecosystem. Each COG represents a specific aspect of the system that has been formally specified and approved through the community governance process.

## What are COGs?

COGs (Covia Open Grid apecifications) are the formal technical specifications that define:

- **Protocol Standards**: Core protocol specifications and message formats
- **Security Standards**: Cryptographic primitives, authentication, and authorization
- **Network Standards**: Peer-to-peer networking, discovery, and routing
- **Data Standards**: Universal Data Assets (UDA) formats and metadata
- **Governance Standards**: Decision-making processes and community participation

## Available COGs

### Core Protocol Specifications

- **[COG-1](./protocol/cogs/COG-001)** - Architecture

## COG Development Process

Each COG follows a structured development process:

1. **Proposal**: Community members propose new COGs or updates to existing ones
2. **Discussion**: Open community discussion and technical analysis
3. **Drafting**: Formal specification drafting with community input
4. **Review**: Technical and security review of reference implementations by experts
5. **Acceptance**: Aproval for offical adoption across the ecosystem

## Contributing to COGs

To contribute to COG development:

1. **Join the community** on Discord and GitHub
2. **Review existing COGs** to understand the current specifications
3. **Propose improvements** or new specifications through the governance process
4. **Participate in discussions** and technical reviews
5. **Help implement** and test COG specifications

## COG Status

Each COG has a status indicating its development stage:

- **Draft**: Under development and community review
- **Proposed**: Ready for community voting
- **Approved**: Formally adopted and implemented
- **Deprecated**: Superseded by newer specifications

*Note: COG specifications are expected to evolve based on community feedback and real-world implementation experience.*
