# Intro to Covia: The HTTP for AI

> **Imagine a world where any organization, big or small, can tap into the global power of AI—securely, openly, and at scale.**

Covia is not just another protocol. It's a revolution: the open standard for **federated orchestration of AI supply chains**. Think of it as the "HTTP for AI"—a universal language for data, compute, and intelligence to flow freely and securely across the digital world.

## 🌐 Why Covia?

AI is the new electricity, but most organizations lack the resources to harness it fully. Covia changes the game:
- **Democratizes AI**: Connects you to the best data, compute, and skills—globally.
- **Open & Interoperable**: Built on open Internet standards, not walled gardens.
- **Trust by Design**: Every asset is cryptographically verifiable and traceable.

## 🔑 Key Concepts (The Cool Stuff)

### Universal Data Assets (UDA)
Every dataset, model, or compute service becomes a **universal asset**—immutable, verifiable, and shareable. Imagine NFTs, but for *anything* digital and useful in AI.

### Venues & Agents
- **Venues**: Digital spaces (like vaults or labs) where assets live and are managed.
- **Agents**: The smart gatekeepers—software that connects your existing systems to the Covia universe, enforcing your rules and unlocking new value.

### Orchestration: AI as a Symphony
Covia lets you compose and run **arbitrary graphs of operations**—think of it as building AI workflows that span the globe, with every step verifiable and auditable.

### Lattice Technology
Covia uses cutting-edge math (lattices!) to make distributed data and operations conflict-free and always in sync. No more data silos, no more trust issues.

## 🚀 What Can You Do with Covia?
- Build and share AI models and datasets with full provenance and trust.
- Monetize your data or compute power in a global marketplace.
- Orchestrate complex, multi-party AI workflows—securely and transparently.
- Bridge your existing enterprise systems into the open AI economy.
