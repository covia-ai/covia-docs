# Build the Open Grid with Us

 The Grid is an open, interoperable fabric for AI—built in the open, by and for developers. If you believe AI should be modular, auditable, and connectable across tools, frameworks, and venues, you’re in the right place.

 - Core (Covia): `https://github.com/covia-ai/covia`
 - Documentation: `https://github.com/covia-ai/covia-docs`
 - Frontend: `https://github.com/covia-ai/frontend`
 - All repositories: `https://github.com/covia-ai`
 - Discord: `https://discord.gg/fywdrKd8QT`

## Why contribute

- Help define open standards that make AI systems composable and portable.
- Ship real infrastructure: venues, adapters, operations, and governance tooling.
- Work in a pragmatic codebase with a strong focus on DX, observability, and security.
- Join an active community of builders (researchers, operators, and application devs).

## Ways you can contribute

- Fix a bug or improve docs (great for first contributions)
- Add or enhance an adapter (e.g., LangChain, HTTP, MCP, custom venues)
- Implement new grid operations or examples
- Improve testing, CI, and developer tooling
- Propose protocol and governance improvements

## Get started in minutes

1) Explore the docs
   - Start at [Overview](./) and the [Grid](./grid).
   - See the [SDK](./sdk) direction and the [Venues](./venues) model.

 2) Pick an issue
    - Core issues: `https://github.com/covia-ai/covia/issues`
    - Docs issues: `https://github.com/covia-ai/covia-docs/issues`
    - Frontend issues: `https://github.com/covia-ai/frontend/issues`
   - Look for labels like "good first issue", "help wanted", or "docs".

3) Run the docs locally (optional, for docs changes)

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run start
```

4) Submit your PR
   - Fork the repo, create a branch, open a PR against `develop`.
   - Provide a concise description, screenshots where helpful, and test notes.

## Development pointers

- Adapters live under the user guide: see `User Guide → Adapters` for integration patterns.
- Keep code clear and self-explanatory; prefer readability over cleverness.
- Add meaningful tests and docs alongside code changes.
- Follow existing formatting and conventions; avoid unrelated refactors.

## Community & support

- Join Discord to ask questions, share work, and find collaborators: `https://discord.gg/fywdrKd8QT`
- Follow updates on X: `https://x.com/CoviaAI`
 - Discussions and proposals happen via issues and PRs on GitHub: `https://github.com/covia-ai`
