# Protocol Overview

Covia is designed as a universal protocol for federated AI orchestration, enabling secure and efficient collaboration between AI agents, data providers, and compute resources across organizational boundaries.

## Core Protocol Components

### 1. Universal Data Assets (UDA)
- Cryptographically verifiable data and model assets
- Immutable provenance tracking
- Standardized metadata and versioning
- Cross-organizational sharing and access control

### 2. Agent Communication Protocol
- Secure message passing between agents
- State synchronization and conflict resolution
- Event-driven coordination
- Multi-party computation support

### 3. Lattice-based Orchestration
- Distributed workflow execution
- Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs)
- Eventual consistency guarantees
- Byzantine fault tolerance

### 4. Trust and Verification Layer
- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy
- Cryptographic attestation of compute
- Verifiable credential system
- Reputation and trust scoring

## Protocol Specifications

The Covia protocol is defined through a set of formal specifications:

1. **Message Format Specification**: Defines the structure and encoding of protocol messages
2. **State Machine Specification**: Details the protocol state transitions and validation rules
3. **Cryptographic Primitives**: Specifies the cryptographic algorithms and security requirements
4. **Network Layer**: Describes the peer-to-peer networking and discovery mechanisms

## Getting Started

To start building with the Covia protocol:

1. Read the [Whitepaper](../protocol/whitepaper) for a deep dive into the protocol design
2. Explore the [Governance Model](../protocol/governance) to understand protocol evolution
3. Join the community and contribute to protocol development

The protocol is continuously evolving through our open governance process, with regular updates and improvements based on community feedback and real-world implementation experience.
