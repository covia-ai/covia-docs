## What is Covia.ai?

Covia is a federated orchestration runtime built for the next generation of AI-native systems—where agents, data, models, and human-in-the-loop steps are coordinated across tools, clouds, and trust boundaries.

If you think of HTTP as the protocol that made the web interoperable, Covia.ai is the orchestration substrate that makes AI interoperable, verifiable, and governable across the enterprise.

Covia isn’t a framework. It’s infrastructure—built for real-world AI systems that must be composable, observable, and secure.

Covia is not just another protocol. It's a revolution: the open standard for **federated orchestration of AI supply chains**. Think of it as grid with a universal language for data, compute, and intelligence to flow freely and securely across the digital world.

## Why Covia?

AI is the new electricity, but most organizations lack the resources to harness it fully. Covia changes the game:
- **Democratises AI**: Connects you to the best data, compute, and skills—globally.
- **Open & Interoperable**: Built on open Internet standards, not walled gardens.
- **Trust by Design**: Every asset is cryptographically verifiable and traceable.

Modern AI systems are fragmented:
	•	Agents are stateless and brittle
	•	Execution logic is hidden in glue code
	•	Compliance is post-hoc, not built-in
	•	Every team rebuilds orchestration, retries, and policy enforcement from scratch

**Covia.ai** changes that:

| Problem | Covia.ai Solution |
|---|---|
| Spaghetti workflows | Graph-based, policy-aware execution runtime |
| Untrusted AI operations | Signed, auditable execution traces per operation |
| Complianca as overhead | Runtime-enforced access control + policy overlays |
| Multi-agent complexity | Native support for memory, retries, fallback, isolation |

## Key Concepts (The Cool Stuff)

### Universal Data Assets (UDA)
Every dataset, model, or compute service becomes a **universal asset**—immutable, verifiable, and shareable. Imagine NFTs, but for *anything* digital and useful in AI.

### Federated Policy Engine 
Enforce per-node trust boundaries and policy constraints. Every execution is cryptographically signed, tracable, and resumable across teams, clouds, and partners. 

### Venues & Agents
- **Venues**: Digital spaces (like vaults or labs) where assets live and are managed.
- **Agents**: The smart gatekeepers—software that connects your existing systems to the Covia universe, enforcing your rules and unlocking new value.

### Universal Runtime Graphs
Define distributed execution graphs across agents, models, SaaS APIs, and human steps. Covia executes them with:
- Scoped memory
- Retry logic
- Real-time policy evaluation
- Full observability + logs
    
### Orchestration: AI as a Symphony
Covia lets you compose and run **arbitrary graphs of operations**—think of it as building AI workflows that span the globe, with every step verifiable and auditable.

### Lattice Technology
Covia uses cutting-edge math (lattices!) to make distributed data and operations conflict-free and always in sync. No more data silos, no more trust issues.

### Audit-Ready by design 
Every execution node generates: 
- Signed state transitions
- Retry logs
- Policy evaluation traces
- Audit-ready metadata

### Developer-Native Tookkit
- CLI to test, simulate, and deploy graphs
- SDK for dynamic graph generation
- Runtime introspection tools
- Plugin-based adapters (e.g., Slack, OpenAI, Notion, FastAPI)
