# Grid

The Covia Grid is the foundational infrastructure that enables distributed AI orchestration across organizational boundaries.

## What is the Grid?

The Grid represents the core networking and coordination layer of the Covia protocol, providing:

- **Distributed Compute Resources**: Access to AI models, data processing, and computational power across the network
- **Peer-to-Peer Communication**: Direct agent-to-agent messaging with built-in security and privacy
- **Resource Discovery**: Automatic discovery and registration of available AI services and data sources
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent distribution of computational workloads across the network

## Grid Architecture

### Network Topology
The Grid operates as a decentralized network where each node can:
- Host AI models and services
- Provide computational resources
- Store and serve data assets
- Participate in consensus and governance

### Security Model
- End-to-end encryption for all communications
- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving computations
- Cryptographic attestation of compute integrity
- Reputation-based trust scoring

## Getting Started with the Grid

This section will provide detailed documentation on:
- Setting up a Grid node
- Connecting to the network
- Deploying AI services
- Managing resources and permissions
