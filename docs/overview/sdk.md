# SDK

The Covia Software Development Kit (SDK) provides developers with the tools and libraries needed to build applications that integrate with the Covia protocol.

## What is the SDK?

The Covia SDK is a comprehensive development toolkit that includes:

- **Client Libraries**: Language-specific libraries for Python, JavaScript, Go, and other popular languages
- **Development Tools**: Command-line tools, debugging utilities, and testing frameworks
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation, tutorials, and code examples
- **Sample Applications**: Pre-built examples demonstrating common use cases

## SDK Components

### Core Libraries
- **Protocol Client**: Low-level protocol implementation for direct Grid communication
- **Agent Framework**: High-level abstractions for building AI agents
- **Data Management**: Tools for working with Universal Data Assets (UDAs)
- **Security Utilities**: Cryptographic primitives and security helpers

### Development Tools
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line interface for common development tasks
- **Testing Framework**: Unit and integration testing utilities
- **Debugging Tools**: Network monitoring, message tracing, and performance analysis
- **Code Generators**: Templates and scaffolding for common application patterns

### Language Support
- **Python**: Primary SDK with full protocol support
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Web and Node.js applications
- **Go**: High-performance applications and services
- **Rust**: Systems programming and performance-critical applications
