# Governance

Covia follows a community-driven governance model that ensures transparent and collaborative evolution of the protocol while maintaining its core principles of openness, security, and interoperability.

## Principles

### 1. Open Participation
- Anyone can propose protocol improvements
- All discussions are public and archived
- Decisions are made through consensus-building
- Clear path for new contributors

### 2. Technical Merit
- Changes evaluated based on technical soundness
- Backward compatibility requirements
- Security considerations paramount
- Performance impact analysis

### 3. Decentralised Decision Making
- Multi-stakeholder governance
- Distributed voting mechanisms
- Prevention of capture by any single entity
- Balance between stability and innovation

## Governance Process

### Protocol Improvement Proposals (PIPs)

1. **Draft Stage**
   - Initial proposal submission
   - Community discussion and feedback
   - Technical specification development

2. **Review Stage**
   - Formal technical review
   - Security analysis
   - Implementation considerations
   - Community impact assessment

3. **Acceptance Stage**
   - Consensus gathering
   - Final specification
   - Implementation planning

4. **Implementation Stage**
   - Reference implementation
   - Testing and validation
   - Deployment coordination

### Decision Making

Decisions about protocol changes follow a structured process:

1. **Discussion Period** (2-4 weeks)
   - Open debate and feedback
   - Technical analysis
   - Impact assessment

2. **Consensus Building** (1-2 weeks)
   - Addressing concerns
   - Refinement of proposal
   - Building broad support

3. **Final Decision** (1 week)
   - Formal acceptance vote
   - Implementation planning
   - Timeline establishment

## Working Groups

### Core Protocol
- Protocol specification maintenance
- Security reviews
- Performance optimization
- Backward compatibility

### Implementation
- Reference implementation
- Testing frameworks
- Integration tools
- Developer documentation

### Community
- User feedback collection
- Education and outreach
- Adoption support
- Event coordination

## Getting Involved

1. Join the discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/covia-ai)
2. Participate in working group meetings
3. Submit or review Protocol Improvement Proposals
4. Contribute to implementation and testing

## Current Governance Status

The protocol is currently in its initial phase with a focus on:

- Establishing core specifications
- Building reference implementations
- Growing the contributor community
- Developing governance processes

We welcome participation from individuals and organizations committed to advancing the future of federated AI orchestration.
