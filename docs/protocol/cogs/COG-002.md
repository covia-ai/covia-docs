This standard specifies the methods for identifying venues and other resources on the grid

##  Purpose

The Grid enables secure and efficient collaboration between AI agents, data providers, and compute resources across organisational boundaries. 

In order to operate effectively as a protocol, it is necessary to be able to identify venues and resources with stable global IDs.

## Specification

### Venue DID

A venue MUST provide a W3C compatible did, e.g. `did:web:venue-1.covia.ai`

The DID must utilise one of the following methods:

- `did:web` for venues identified by a public URL with HTTPS
- `did:key` for other venues
- `did:convex` for venues registered on the Convex network

A venue MAY provide multiple equivalent DIDs which resolve to the same venue. If it does so, it MUST provide a `canonicalID` which specifies its primary DID, and return this as the `id` property for its DID document.

### Asset DID

Assets MUST have a DID constructed where:
- The path is `/a/{asset-id}`
- `{asset-id}` is the Asset ID, i.e. the SHA256 hash of the asset metadata, in hexadecimal

Example:

`did:web:venue-1.covia.ai/a/14a3a6b804629835f5466d03f789dd92a45381474d58c1224dfe344e6934c022`

The hexadecimal asset ID MAY be prepended by `0x` and/or contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters.

The canonical ID of an asset MUST exclude `0x` and be in lowercase.

Venues SHOULD be capable of providing a DID document for any asset they host, subject to authorisation.
