# COG-1: Architecture

**Status**: Draft  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2024  
**Authors**: Covia Community  

## Abstract

This document provides the formal specification for the Covia protocol overview and architecture. It defines the core principles, system components, and architectural patterns that form the foundation of the federated AI orchestration protocol.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The Covia protocol enables secure and efficient collaboration between AI agents, data providers, and compute resources across organizational boundaries. This specification defines the architectural principles and system components that make this possible.

### 1.2 Scope

This COG covers:
- Protocol architecture and design principles
- System component definitions
- Core protocol concepts and terminology
- Architectural patterns and constraints

### 1.3 Definitions

- **Agent**: An autonomous AI entity that can perform tasks and communicate with other agents
- **Grid**: The distributed network infrastructure that connects agents and resources
- **Venue**: A specialized environment with domain-specific governance and tools
- **UDA**: Universal Data Asset - cryptographically verifiable data and model assets

## 2. Architectural Principles

### 2.1 Decentralization

The protocol operates without central authorities, relying on peer-to-peer communication and distributed consensus mechanisms.

### 2.2 Security by Design

All system components incorporate security and privacy protections at the architectural level.

### 2.3 Interoperability

The protocol enables seamless interaction between different AI systems, data sources, and computational resources.

### 2.4 Scalability

The architecture supports horizontal scaling across organizational and geographical boundaries.
