# Whitepaper

## Abstract

Covia introduces a novel protocol for federated AI orchestration, enabling secure and efficient collaboration between autonomous agents across organizational boundaries. This whitepaper presents the theoretical foundations, technical architecture, and implementation considerations of the Covia protocol.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
The rise of artificial intelligence has created a need for secure, scalable infrastructure to coordinate AI agents across organizational boundaries. Current solutions are limited by centralized architectures, trust requirements, and interoperability challenges.

### 1.2 Vision
Covia aims to be the "HTTP of AI"â€”a universal protocol enabling seamless collaboration between AI agents, data providers, and compute resources while maintaining security, privacy, and autonomy.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Universal Data Assets (UDA)

UDAs are the fundamental building blocks of the Covia protocol, representing any digital asset (data, models, compute) as verifiable, immutable entities:

```typescript
interface UniversalDataAsset {
  id: string;           // Unique identifier
  type: AssetType;     // Data, Model, Compute
  metadata: Metadata;   // Asset-specific metadata
  proof: Proof;        // Cryptographic proof
  access: AccessControl; // Permission structure
}
```

### 2.2 Lattice-based State Management

Covia uses lattice theory to manage distributed state:

- Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs)
- Partial order of operations
- Eventually consistent state
- Byzantine fault tolerance

### 2.3 Agent Communication Protocol

```typescript
interface Message {
  sender: AgentId;
  recipient: AgentId;
  type: MessageType;
  payload: any;
  signature: Signature;
  timestamp: Timestamp;
}
```
