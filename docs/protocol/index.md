# Protocol

The Covia protocol is the foundational specification that enables federated AI orchestration across organizational boundaries.

## Protocol Components

### Core Specifications

- **[Whitepaper](./whitepaper)** - Comprehensive technical specification of the protocol design, architecture, and implementation details
- **[Governance](./governance)** - Protocol governance model, decision-making processes, and community participation guidelines

### Key Protocol Features

#### Universal Data Assets (UDA)
- Cryptographically verifiable data and model assets
- Immutable provenance tracking with blockchain-based verification
- Standardized metadata and versioning across the network
- Cross-organizational sharing with fine-grained access control

#### Agent Communication Protocol
- Secure, end-to-end encrypted message passing between AI agents
- State synchronization with conflict resolution mechanisms
- Event-driven coordination for real-time collaboration
- Multi-party computation support for privacy-preserving operations

#### Lattice-based Orchestration
- Distributed workflow execution across the network
- Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) for consistency
- Eventual consistency guarantees with strong eventual consistency
- Byzantine fault tolerance for robust operation

#### Trust and Verification Layer
- Zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving computations
- Cryptographic attestation of compute integrity and results
- Verifiable credential system for identity and permissions
- Reputation and trust scoring for network participants

## Getting Started

To understand and work with the Covia protocol:

1. **Read the [Whitepaper](./whitepaper)** for a deep dive into the technical specifications
2. **Review the [Governance Model](./governance)** to understand how the protocol evolves
3. **Explore the [Overview section](../overview)** for high-level concepts and architecture
4. **Join the community** to contribute to protocol development and governance

## Protocol Evolution

The Covia protocol is designed to evolve through community governance:

- **Open Development**: All protocol changes are proposed and discussed publicly
- **Community Voting**: Protocol upgrades are decided through community consensus
- **Backward Compatibility**: Changes maintain compatibility with existing implementations
- **Gradual Migration**: Protocol updates support smooth transitions for all participants

The protocol continues to evolve based on real-world implementation experience, community feedback, and emerging requirements from the AI ecosystem.
