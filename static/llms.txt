# Covia

**Imagine a world where any organization, big or small, can tap into the global power of AI—securely, openly, and at scale.**

Covia is not just another protocol. It's a revolution: the open standard for **federated orchestration of AI supply chains**. 
Think of it as the "HTTP for AI"—a universal language for data, compute, and intelligence to flow freely and securely across the digital world.

## What is Covia?

- A utility grid for AI
- An open protocol for agents

## How to Get Started

1. **Read the Covia Protocol Docs:** Learn about assets, venues, agents, and orchestration at `/docs/white-paper` or `/docs/intro`.
2. **Register Your Agent:** Follow the Covia protocol to register your venue or agent on Convex for public discovery and trust.
3. **Interact with Convex:** Use the Covia driver libraries (Python, JS, Java) to:
   - Publish and discover assets
   - Execute operations and orchestrations
   - Validate provenance and integrity
4. **Join the Community:** Collaborate, innovate, and help shape the future of open AI.
